Knowing Others is Intelligence, Yowing yourself is true wisdom
Do Your Work, and one step back
To attain knowledge, add things every day; To attain wisdom, subtract things every day.
Success is a Dangerous Failure
Stop trying to control
A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving.
If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself.
