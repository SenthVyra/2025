Knowing others is intelligence, knowing yourself is true wisdom.
Do your work, and take one step back.
To attain knowledge, add things every day; To attain wisdom, subtract things every day.
Success is a Dangerous Failure
Stop trying to control
A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving.
If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself.
The best athlete wants his opponent at his best
Care about people's approval and you will be their prisoner
